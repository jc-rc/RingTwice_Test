JC's submission for RingTwice's Design + Technical test

- Ground work: Set up Tailwind + darkmode ; i18next for localization ; FontAwesome (free version ) ☹️; dedicated files for more specific Styling (not easily achievable with TW) and for animations.

- AI tools used: CURSOR, via it's rules, it can help me always mantain certain patterns, and repetitive tasks on check. Such as keepiing the translation files updated.

- Zustand as a easy to use state management for the theme, which is controlled by toggling a class 'all the way at the top' but controlled via an 'inner' component
